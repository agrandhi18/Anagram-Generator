# Anagram

This project generates gibberish anagrams based on the input text given by the user
* It would not replace the anagrams whose respective checkboxes are checked during re-roll(when the submit button is clikced)
* It would replace all the anagrams if the text changes in the textbox
* Sortorder would be saved during re-roll or text change
* Made sure all the linting errors are removed
* Could not write unit tests due to time factor
